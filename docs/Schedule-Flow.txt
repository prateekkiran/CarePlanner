A. Design Principles (for this new flow)
One primary decision per stepAt any time, user sees only 1–3 fields, and only those that depend on previous inputs.
System does the heavy liftingUse data to filter and pre-fill:
Only show services that are actually authorized.
Show time windows that respect clinic hours + auth + staff capacity.
Pre-select staff and location based on usual patterns.
Inline, context-aware validationsSystem doesn’t just block; it guides:
“You can schedule up to 1.5 hours here; auth runs out after that.”
“These 3 staff are both eligible and free for this slot.”
Auto-draft & resumableAt each step, the system quietly saves a draft.
B. High-Level Step Flow
We’ll reframe the flow as:
Select client → 2. Choose intent (what are we doing?) → 3. Pick service →
Pick date & duration → 5. Select staff → 6. Pick location →
Decide recurrence → 8. Review & confirm
Only one decision group visible at a time.
C. Step-by-Step Flow With Automations
Step 1 – Select Client (and silently load brain)
What user sees:
Just:
Search client field
List of recent clients (optional)
As soon as a client is chosen, the system silently loads:
Active funding sources & authorizations
Treatment plan (target weekly hours, service mix)
Usual service locations (home vs center)
Usual staff assigned to this client
Automation:
If client is inactive → immediate clear warning and disable billable paths.
If no active auth → show simple branch:
“This client has no active ABA authorization.[Schedule non-billable] [Cancel]”
Only after a valid client state is confirmed do we reveal Step 2.
Step 2 – “What are we scheduling?” (Intent + Service)
We don’t dump all services. We ask intent first.
UI:
Question:
“What type of visit are you scheduling for <ClientName>?”
Buttons/tiles:
Ongoing ABA therapy
Assessment / Reassessment
Parent training
Supervision
Other
When user taps one, we show a service picker filtered by that intent:
Services list is already pre-filtered by:
What the client is authorized for
What’s clinically relevant to that intent
Automation here:
Show only services tied to active auths at the top (and label them):
“Recommended (covered)”
Collapse or visually separate:
“Other internal/non-billable services”
When a service is selected, the system:
Pre-sets default duration from catalog (e.g., 120 mins)
Knows allowed staff roles (BCBA, RBT...)
Knows allowed POS (center/home/telehealth)
Only then do we show Next.
Step 3 – Date & Duration (Constrained by Authorization + Clinic Hours)
Now we decide when and how long – but we limit this using the data we already loaded.
UI:
Question:
“When should this session happen?”
User sees:
A mini date picker (calendar) – only future dates, grey out days beyond auth end date.
After picking a date, show a duration selector with:
30 min, 60 min, 90 min, 120 min
Smart default based on service (e.g., 120 min)
Automation & guardrails:
Authorization-aware duration limits
System checks remaining authorized hours/units for that service.
If remaining is less than default, duration picker is capped:
Example: only 1 hour left for this auth
System shows info:
“Remaining authorized time: 1.0 hours until 15 Jan.”
Duration options above that show as disabled:
120 min greyed out with tooltip: “Exceeds remaining auth time.”
Clinic-level constraints
If the chosen date is a clinic holiday or closed day → step shows inline:
“Clinic is closed on this date. Pick another day.”
Only after a valid date + duration are chosen does time selection appear.
Time selection that respects clinic hours
Once date + duration picked:
Show time slots only within clinic hours (e.g. 8–6)
Slots that would push session past closing time are hidden or disabled:
5 pm start for a 2-hr session might be disabled if clinic closes at 6.
After a valid date + time + duration is selected, we move on.
Step 4 – Staff Selection (Filtered & Ranked Automatically)
Now that we know client + service + date + time + duration, the system can do magic.
UI:
Question:
“Who will deliver this session?”
User sees:
A ranked list of staff cards:
Assigned Staff First: those already on the client’s care team
Then Other eligible staff
Each card shows:
Name, role (RBT/BCBA/etc)
Home location (or site)
Daily load indicator: e.g. 6.5 / 8 hours booked
Conflict indicator for that slot: ✅ Available or ⚠ Overlap or ⚠ Tight travel window
Automation & filter logic:
Before any options are shown, system filters down:
Credential filter
Only staff whose roles/credentials are appropriate for this service + payer.
Location / modality filter
If we know this will likely be home/center/telehealth (from client/service hints), we prioritize staff who actually serve that modality.
Schedule availability
Remove staff with absolute conflicts.
Deprioritize staff nearing daily/weekly hour thresholds.
Travel feasibility (for home/community)
If staff has adjacent visits:
Exclude staff where travel buffer is insufficient.
Mark staff “OK” or “Risky” with small icon + tooltip.
So the scheduler mostly just picks from a short, smartly ordered list, not a long unfiltered list.
Only when staff is chosen do we move to location.
Step 5 – Location (Type + Details, POS + EVV Automated)
Now we clarify where this session will happen. But we already know a lot.
UI:
Question:
“Where will this session take place?”
Show 3–4 location type buttons:
[Center] [Home] [School] [Telehealth]
Based on client’s usual pattern and service type, preselect one. Example:
If this client almost always has home sessions with this service → Home preselected.
Once type is chosen:
If Center:
Show only:
Site (default to staff’s primary site)
Room dropdown – rooms that are at capacity in this slot show as greyed or warning.
If Home:
Show address read-only (from client record)
A note:
“Travel time from previous session for Sam: 18 min. Gap: 25 min → OK.”
Auto-flag EVV if this payer/state requires EVV for home-based ABA.
If Telehealth:
Show:
Eligibility chip:
“Covered for this payer and service”
Or “Not covered – will be non-billable”
A toggle:
“Generate telehealth link automatically” (checked by default)
If School:
Show school name prefilled (if we know it), else a search.
Option to add a school contact person (optional).
Automation:
POS code is fully automatic based on location type.
EVV flag is automatic for home/community where required.
If location choice is incompatible with payer rules → user sees:
“This payer does not cover home-based sessions for this service.[Switch to center] [Continue as non-billable].”
Once location is valid, we unlock recurrence.
Step 6 – Recurrence (Guided by Treatment Plan + Auth)
Now we decide if this is a one-off or recurring.
UI:
Toggle:
Does this repeat? [No, just this session] [Yes, create a schedule]
If No → jump straight to review.
If Yes:
We show a simple pattern builder, but pre-seeded:
Automation:
Treatment-plan-based suggestion
If treatment plan for this service says “4x/week, 2 hours each” and we just created a 2-hr Monday session:
Suggest:
“Based on the treatment plan, you usually schedule this 4x/week.[Add Wed, Thu, Fri at same time] [Customize]”
Authorization-aware recurrence limit
System estimates total hours from recurrence and compares to auth:
“This pattern for the remaining auth period will use ~36 of 40 hours → ✅ OK”
or “This pattern exceeds auth by ~12 hours → ⚠ Limit end date to 15 Aug or reduce frequency.”
Staff + room + clinic hours validation across series
Show only a summary:
“3 instances fall on holidays”
“2 instances conflict with Sam’s existing meetings”
Provide one click action:
[Auto-adjust conflicts] → system suggests shifting or skipping problematic occurrences.
[Show details] → for power users.
The scheduler chooses:
End condition:
End after X sessions
End on date
End with auth end date (smart default)
Still only a few controls visible at once.
Step 7 – Review & Commit (Minimal, Focused)
Finally, a lightweight summary that surfaces automations and key validations, not every field.
UI:
Card layout:
Card 1 – Who & What
Client: X
Service: 97153 – ABA therapy
Funding: Auth #123 (32/40 hours used after these sessions)
Card 2 – When & Where
Single: [Date, Time, Duration, Location]
Or Recurrence:
“Mon, Wed, Thu — 3–5 PM — from 5 Aug to 15 Oct (24 sessions)”
Card 3 – Staff & Risk Summary
Staff: Sam (RBT)
Staff load: Max 7.5 hrs/day, 32 hrs/week after this schedule
Flags:
✅ No unauthorized services
✅ EVV configured (home sessions)
⚠ 2 occurrences fall on a school holiday → “We’ll skip these by default”
Actions:
Primary: Schedule 24 sessions
Secondary: Save as draft schedule (if something needs Clinical Director sign-off)
There’s no long form here. It’s a structured confirmation that acknowledges all the smart decisions the system made.
D. Examples of Automations & Validations (Checklist)
Here’s a quick list of automation opportunities we explicitly built in:
Client selection
Auto-load active auths, treatment plan, usual settings.
Service selection
Pre-filter services to those authorized for this client and intent.
Label “Recommended (covered)” vs “Non-billable/Other”.
Duration selection
Cap editable duration by remaining authorized time.
Hide or disable unrealistic durations given clinic hours.
Date/time choice
Grey out dates past auth end date.
Hide/disable times that push past clinic hours or staff’s maximum hours.
Staff selection
Filter by credential, availability, location, and travel feasibility.
Sort by “assigned to client” + least load + shortest travel.
Location
Default to most common setting for this client/service.
Auto-derive POS and EVV requirements; block invalid payer-combinations.
Recurrence
Suggest patterns derived from treatment plan.
Limit total projected hours by auth; show usage bar.
Pre-handle holidays, staff PTO, room closures with “auto adjust”.
Review
Show compact summary of: auth usage, EVV status, conflict resolutions.
Provide clear risk chips, not cryptic error logs.
