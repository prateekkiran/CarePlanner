1. Context & Objectives
1.1 Overview of the Scheduler
The Scheduling module is a core part of an ABA practice management ecosystem that typically includes:
Client & caregiver management
Authorizations & insurance
Clinical documentation (notes, programs, outcomes)
Billing & claims
Payroll & timesheets
EVV (Electronic Visit Verification) for home/community visits
Reporting & analytics
For ABA, scheduling is not just calendar events; it drives revenue, compliance, and clinical continuity. ABA practices rely on high-frequency, long-term recurring sessions across multiple locations and modalities (center, home, school, telehealth).
Key business outcomes for the Scheduler:
Maximize schedule utilization & productivity (reduce idle therapist time and minimize gaps/overlaps).
Reduce cancellations & no-shows via automation (reminders, easy reschedule flows, waitlist auto-fill).
Ensure compliance with payor & regulatory rules (real-time authorization checks, EVV for Medicaid-funded in-home services, correct POS, eligible service codes).
Support clinical continuity & outcomes (stable recurring schedules that match treatment plans, e.g., prescribed hours/week).
Improve caregiver & staff experience (self-service portal, clear visibility, fewer surprises, predictable routines).
1.2 Scope
In-scope (for this Scheduler module):
Appointment creation & management: single, recurring, and group sessions; center, home/community, school, and telehealth sessions; supervision and overlap sessions (BCBA + technician).
Staff scheduling & availability management: working hours, locations, travel buffers, PTO/blackout time.
Waitlist management: client waitlists by location, time window, staff, service type; manual and semi-automated suggestions.
Multi-location & resource scheduling: rooms/areas, capacity constraints, staff working across sites.
Basic telehealth integration from a scheduling perspective: handle time zones, generate/join links via integrated telehealth provider (stubbed).
Authorization-aware scheduling: validation against remaining units/hours, dates, codes, POS.
Notifications & reminders (functional specification): trigger rules and HIPAA-constrained content for SMS/email/app reminders.
EVV-related scheduling hooks: mark sessions that require EVV; provide necessary EVV metadata (type, location, scheduled times).
Role-based permissions for scheduling actions.
Out-of-scope (now; to be considered for future phases):
Full EVV capture workflows & integrations (start/stop, GPS, telephony).
Advanced optimization / auto-scheduler (algorithmic matching for entire week/month at once).
Complex payroll rules (e.g., overtime rate calculation, differential pay).
Deep telehealth platform features (video, chat, whiteboarding).
Custom patient engagement campaigns (beyond transactional reminders).
Advanced capacity planning/forecasting (long-term utilization modelling).
1.3 Assumptions

Home/community-based heavy: travel buffers, EVV, geographic clustering, route optimization are key.
3. Core Scheduling Use Cases & Flows
Each use case includes: description, preconditions, trigger, main flow, alternative flows, unhappy flows, and validations.
3.1 Create a New Appointment
Covers single, recurring, and group sessions across center, home, school, and telehealth; matches staff based on availability, skills, credentials, and payor requirements.
Key preconditions: client active; staff active with required credential; at least one valid authorization (if insurance-funded).
High-level happy path (single center-based individual session):
Scheduler initiates 'New Appointment' from calendar or client/staff profile with date/time pre-selected.
Select client; system loads client status and active funding/authorizations.
Select service type (CPT/HCPCS + modifiers); system sets default duration and allowed staff roles.
Select staff; system shows staff availability and potential conflicts.
Confirm start/end time or duration; system computes units.
System validates authorization (dates, units, payer rules).
Select location type (center, home, school, telehealth); system sets POS and EVV flags where applicable.
Optionally assign room and notes; system checks room capacity.
Scheduler saves appointment; calendars update and notifications trigger per configuration.
Alternative flows: recurring sessions (daily/weekly), group sessions, multiple staff, partial validation failures (warnings vs hard stops).
3.2 Reschedule an Existing Appointment
Allows changes to date/time and/or staff while preserving linkage to client, authorization, and documentation.
Key steps:
User opens existing appointment and chooses 'Reschedule'.
User adjusts date/time; system shows conflicts, alternative time suggestions, and re-checks authorization.
If needed, user switches staff; system enforces credential, location, and caseload rules.
Updates appointment and sends notifications for rescheduled session.
Variations: caregiver-initiated reschedule via portal (with policy-driven constraints); admin review when rules are violated.
3.3 Cancel an Appointment
Supports staff, caregiver, or clinic-driven cancellations with categories: timely cancel, late cancel, no-show.
Key behavior:
Capture cancellation reason and time relative to policy thresholds.
Classify cancellation type (timely/late/no-show).
Release slot to availability and optionally trigger waitlist suggestions.
Send appropriate notifications to staff and caregivers.
Mass cancellation for weather or holidays is supported as a bulk operation with consistent reason codes.
3.4 Recurring Schedules
Create long-term recurring schedules aligned to treatment plans (e.g., 20 hours/week for 6 months).
Capabilities:
Support daily, weekly, and bi-weekly patterns with specific days and end conditions.
Estimate authorization consumption across all occurrences and warn when projected usage exceeds authorization.
Handle holidays and blackouts by skipping, shifting, or flagging conflicting occurrences.
Allow editing of recurrence (this occurrence / this and future occurrences).
3.5 Waitlist Management
Manage clients waiting for services and automatically suggest them into new openings.
Key features:
Add clients to waitlist with preferences (location, time window, staff, service type).
Rank waitlisted clients by configurable criteria (e.g., date added, age, priority).
When a slot opens, system suggests best-matching waitlist candidates; scheduler can convert suggestion into an appointment.
3.6 Staff Scheduling & Availability
Define working hours, preferred locations, blackout times (PTO, training, meetings), and travel buffers.
Key behaviors:
Staff or admins set recurring weekly availability and blackout blocks.
System treats availability and blackouts as constraints on appointment creation.
For home/community sessions, enforce minimum travel time between appointments with configurable buffers.
3.7 Multi-location & Resource Scheduling
Handle centers, rooms, and special resources (assessment tools, devices).
Key behaviors:
Each appointment includes a location and optional room/area.
Rooms have capacities; system prevents overbooking beyond capacity or warns when nearing limits.
Staff can have multiple default locations with allowable days/times per site.
3.8 Client-Side Interactions
Portal or app for caregivers to view and interact with schedules.
Capabilities (MVP):
View upcoming sessions in list and calendar formats.
Request reschedule or cancellation subject to policy constraints.
Receive reminders and notifications via configured channels (SMS/email/app).
3.9 Supervision & Overlap Sessions
Support BCBA supervision sessions overlapping with RBT sessions with correct billing and scheduling logic.
Key behaviors:
System allows overlapping sessions only when configured as supervision/overlap types.
Supervision sessions are linked to underlying technician sessions for traceability and ratio calculations.
Supervision time must be a subset of the main session duration.
3.10 Telehealth Scheduling
Schedule telehealth sessions while respecting eligibility rules and time zones.
Key behaviors:
Mark appointments as telehealth; auto-assign appropriate telehealth POS.
Check telehealth eligibility per payer, service, and client.
Integrate with telehealth provider for secure link creation and storage.
Include secure join links in reminders while maintaining PHI-safe content.
4. Validations, Business Rules & Constraints
Rules are grouped into authorization-related, staff-related, client-related, scheduling consistency, and compliance/regulatory.
4.1 Authorization-Related Rules
Appointments must fall within authorization start/end dates.
Estimated units/hours must not exceed remaining authorized units/hours.
Service code + modifiers must be allowed by payer for that client.
Place of service must be allowed for that service and payer.
Daily/weekly limits on duration/frequency must be enforced where configured.
Group vs individual constraints (allowed group size, allowed group codes).
4.2 Staff-Related Rules
Staff must be active (not terminated/suspended).
Staff role/credentials must meet the minimum requirements for the service code.
No overlapping sessions for the same staff unless explicitly allowed (e.g., supervision, group).
Staff hours per day/week must not exceed configured thresholds (fatigue/compliance).
Staff must be assigned or allowed at the selected location.
4.3 Client-Related Rules
Client must be active (not discharged or on hold).
Client must be eligible for the selected service based on treatment plan and funding.
Client must be on the selected staff member’s care team or allowed exceptions must be respected.
